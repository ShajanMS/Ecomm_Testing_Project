# Ecomm_Testing_Project

The goal of this project is to build a system that can automatically test the functionality of the Best Buy e-commerce website (https://www.bestbuy.com/).The system will use Selenium, a tool for automating web browsers, to navigate through the website and perform various actions, such as adding items to the shopping cart and checking out.
